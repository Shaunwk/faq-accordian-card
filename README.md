### What I learned

I learned how to use a forEach method in JavaScript to iterate over the different FAQ questions. 
Also how to rotate a arrow in the if/else statement.


Progress update 5/17/2023

Javascript has been fixed so the 2 clicks is no longer a issue. I was using a if/else statement and changed it to a classList.toggle instead.

CSS I added the new classes created by the classList.toggle and updated them as needed like .show has display:block; 
I incorporated some transition effects on the arrow so it rotates on click. I also used animation with a keyframe to ease in the answers.
